Part 1)

1)  Data Structure : 
    Customers : A Slice for representing Customers
    Cashiers : Just a variable representing number of cashiers to spawn go routines accordingly
    

2)  Variables: noOfCashiers (int)
               noOfCustomers (int)
               timePerCustomer (int)
               Index (int) to keep a track on current customer


3) Concepts of Go in usage:
                1)Mutex as index will be critical section
                2) Go routines to achieve parallel working of cashiers
                3) Channel assocaited to each cashier to communicate work done


Part 2)

    Struct : struct BankSim{
            noOfCashiers (int)
            noOfCustomers (int)
            timePerCustomer (int)
            Customers ([]int, noOfCustomers)
    } 

Part 3)
    Psuedocode:


    1) Accept no of cashiers,customers,timePerCustomer
    2) Initialize BankSim struct and create 
    3) Spawn go routines representing every cashier and the cashier will get the hold of customer 
       through index which will be global and critical to update
    4) Select over various receiving channels
